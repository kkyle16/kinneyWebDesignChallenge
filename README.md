# Web Design Challenge

This challenge focused on using HTML and bootstrap in order to create a dashboard showcasing graphs and data drawn from a weather API in a previous challenge. This dashboard consists of 5 types of pages:

+ Landing Page to with an explanation of the project
+ Visualization Pages for each visualization with an explanation of the findings
+ Comparison Page to compare the visualizations
+ Data Page that displayed all of the data used to produce the visuals

A navbar was also included to allow traversal to each page no matter where you were.
